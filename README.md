A simple website, made with HTML and CSS, to get new Replit bounty hunters on the role, giving them the best chance of success.

## The benefits of being a Replit Bounty Hunter?
1. Enhance your skills, and earn money at the same time 
2. Beginner friendly - you can complete your first bounty in a week or two
3. No "Application Fees" like other freelancing platforms

## Technologies:
1. HTML
2. CSS

## Project Motive:
This is a certification project I get to do, for the course I am following. The project, is to make some sort of technical documentation, or guide of some sort. After some thought, I figured that having a quickstart guide for how to start earning money as a Replit Bounty Hunter would possibly help people, to support their family financially, and enhance their skillsets.

## Contributions:
If you really like the idea of this project, and you see something you can improve, feel free to **fork** this repo, make your changes, and submit a pull request. If you see any spelling mistake on this markdown file, or on the website, please make an **issue**, so that I can fix it. Thanks.

## What I learnt from making this project:
1. HTML
2. CSS

## Mobile Responsiveness:

Once I learn Javascript from freeCodeCamp's Curriculum, I will update this project, to have a burger icon on the header, to show the nav items. There is no place to put all the side nav items, as the text are quite long. Feel free to make a pull request if you are up for the challenge.

## License:
This project is under the MIT license. Feel free to do whatever you wnat with it, I really don't care.
